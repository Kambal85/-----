Hi, I'm Mohamed Suliman
 
Iâ€™m a senior researcher at Northeastern university's civic AI lab, my current work focuses on the impact of AI on society, disinformation and the online memories recollection. You may would like to read my scientific papers and articles.


In my free time I enjoy walking, reading books and writing short-stories and haiku poems.
