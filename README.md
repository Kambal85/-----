Hi, I'm Mohamed Suliman
 
Iâ€™m a senior researcher at Northeastern university's civic AI lab, my current work focuses on the impact of AI on society and disinformation. You may want to read my <a href="https://github.com/Kambal85/-----/blob/main/Essays.md">essays</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-lJgf38AAAAJ">papers</a>



In my free time I enjoy walking, reading books and writing short-stories and haiku poems.
