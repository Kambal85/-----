I care about information!
 
Iâ€™m currently a researcher at Northeastern university and a regular contributor to Global voices where I write about issues related to                               Technology, I hold a degree in Engineering but I have deep interest in social science
 
 
 
My articles and op-eds appeared on Tech Policy.Press, Global Voices, American Philosophical association, and Rest of World.
